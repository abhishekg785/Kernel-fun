Fun with Linux Kernel
----------------------

Motivation
----------
The best way to learn something is to implement it. Simple !
So to get into on how the linux kernel works, the best thing will be to create something for the kernel itself.

Contents
--------
I have started with a simple hello-world module and more will be added with time.

Compiling them
--------------
I have the kernel 4.2.0-27-generic running on my laptop.
use ' uname -r ' to find out yours.

Installing linux headers:
  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-4.2.0-27-generic

To compile them, just run
  make

Load the module into the Kernel (at your own risk!)
  sudo insmod hello-world.ko
  dmesg | tail
 
  should display the 'hello world' message
